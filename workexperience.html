Pallbearer at Draagkracht, 2016-present: <br><br>
When I turned 17 I graduated HAVO, this was also the time my brother and his friends were working at 'Draagkracht'. A company who sends pallbearers to funerals.
My job was to make sure everything went well and respectfull. To carry the coffin to wherever it needed to go. This mostly has tought me to respect those who have lost someone, or just anyone in general, since you never know what a person has been through.
<p>Worker at Sligro, 2019-present: <br><br>
In the year 2018-2019 I quit my study because my brother passed away, in this time I also started living at my own place. When I quit I could not rely on the 'studiefinanciering' anymore so I had to find different ways of getting the money untill I started school again. Sligro provided me that oppertunity, they offered my a relatively high salary, in return I worked 40 hours a week. The shifts were from 22:00 untill 08:00, it was after these shifts that I learned to appriciate the things around me more. I am still working there to this day but in another function, with shifts that are more in line with my school hours.

Grocery deliverer for Jumbo, 2018-2019: <br><br>
I had stopped working from 2016 untill 2018, I did this in order to focus more on my studies, in the end I realised I needed work. I did not need work for just money, but also to appriciate time for myself more. Delivering groceries for the Jumbo was just the thing I needed. It thought me a great deal of responsibility, not only did I have to deliver the groceries people already payed for, but I also had to take care of the equipment that the Jumbo provided me which included the delivery vehicle!

Stock clerc Albertheijn XL, 2014-2016: <br><br>
This was my very first job, I was just a stock clerc, but it did tought me some valuable lessons. Not everyone is of the same value to a company, even though my young age I was only a number. It tought me the basics, be on time, teach your elders with respect and mostly the value of money.
