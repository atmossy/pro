<p class="Aboutme-2">
My name is Wout Dreessen, I am 21 years old and studying media and application management. I am born in Flushing, where as of today I am still living. 
<br>
<br>
What defines a person, the way he acts today? The way he acts tomorrow?
What defines a person, for me, is what he or she has been through and how it influences the people around them.
<br>
<br>
What defines me, what I have been through, is a lot. I have lost a lot, the loss of my brother forces me to grow up faster than most people of my age. Even though I have lost a lot, I did not let it get me down, life goes on with or without you. 
<br>
<br>
This has made me able to work well in groups, ‘ do not sweat the little things’ this is a motto I use when working in groups. Not everyone will like you, this also works the other way around. Treat people the same way you want to be treated.
