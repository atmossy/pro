The Pok√©mon game was a school project, in this project we got a code handed to us, but there were missing parts.
<br>
<br>
It was our task, with the use of class and sequence diagrams, to fill the gaps in the code and make it a working game!

<p class="cardgametext"> 
The card game project thought me how to write code from scratch, in this project we still had class and sequence diagrams handed to us. But there was no code given from the start!
<br>
<br>
This game was a simple game, the game gives you a card, which it removed from the deck. The given card gets compared to the next card. And you have to guess if it is higher or lower!

This project is the very project you are looking at! The creation of this website, is thus far the only project where we got nothing.
<br>
<br>
With our creative mind, a course of actions (which we made ourselves) and the obtained knowledge from the lesson we created this site. To function as our curriculum vitae, it also shows us in a fun way what we can do so far! 
</p>
<p class="calculatortext">
The calculator is the very first project I worked on. The idea was simple, make a calculator which can divide, multiply, add, subtract, square and do exponentiation. But all without using the multiply function and divide function!
<br>
<br>
This thought me to think outside of the box, with programming a lot is possible, you are but only limited by your imagination.
